1.3	New features:
        Decodes voice from ProVoice signals (requires -fp option)
	algid and kid are now shown in hex notation

	Fixed bugs:
	auto output gain now has faster rise time
	MoTDMA is now correctly labeled X2-TDMA

1.2	New features:
        Decodes voice for DMR standard (including MOTOTRBO)
        Full metadata (src, talkgroup, lcinfo, mfid, lcformat, mi, algid, keyid) for X2-TDMA
        TDMA slot identification for X2-TDMA/DMR/MOTOTRBO
        Identifies non-voice frame types for X2-TDMA/DMR/MOTOTRBO
        Frame only (no voice yet) support for 9600 baud NXDN
	Auto leveling audio output gain (default) and -g option for fixed gain
	GFSK modulation optimizations and improved C4FM/GFSK/QPSK auto detect

	Fixed bugs:
	nac was showing wrong ID
	p25 metadata (lcinfo, mfid, lfcormat, mi, keyid, algid, lsd) are now
	  printed out in the correct bit order (MSB -> LSB), was reversed.
	fixed serveral bugs in dsd_upsample.c, with improved quality
	
1.1	New features:
	Scanner control options to allow scan resume during certain TDULC
        Improved upsampling function audio quality
        Greatly improved handling of X2-TDMA frames
	Much faster QPSK decision point tracking by default

	Fixed bugs:
	playMbeFiles was not output to .wav file when -w was given
    	Now correctly detects/handles Mot and P25 talkgroup formats
	PDU frames were not detected

1.0.3	Fixed buggy C4FM/QPSK auto detection and added -A option to adjust it.
